      Have you ever wondered, when you come back to your home after a long day's work and <em>crave</em> for something <strong>delicious</strong>, but doesn't want to cook something which requires <em>high effort</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wouldn't it be really nice if you could make something really delicious with <strong>minimal</strong> effort and by using ingredients which are <em>leftovers</em> just taking up space in your refrigerator.
