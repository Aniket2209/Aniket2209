- 👋 Hi, I’m Aniket Srivastava, someone with an interest in computer software and programming.
     I want to learn as much about computers as much is needed to guaranty me a job.
     On a side note I also am interested in learning about AI and will probably someday try to make one;)
     All in all getting a reasonable Job in reputed company is my first priority.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science as a Btech student.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project necessary for placement and which can give some practical knowledge about the corporate world out there.
- 📫 You can reach me via my mail or mobile no. which i will upload in the future(when i think will be safe to).
